## 🔧 Issues Found & Resolutions

### Issue #1: Resources Endpoint Path ⚠️ MINOR
**Severity**: Low (non-critical)  
**Status**: RESOLVED  

**Problem**:
- Test was calling `/api/v1/resources/resource/` (404 Not Found)
- Should call `/api/v1/resources/` (200 OK)

**Root Cause**:
- Router registration: `router.register(r'resources', ResourceViewSet, basename='resources-resource')`
- Creates endpoint at `/resources/` not `/resources/resource/`

**Impact**:
- Feature actually works perfectly (8 resources in database)
- Only test had wrong endpoint path
- **All resources data accessible once corrected**

**Resolution**:
- ✅ Endpoint path corrected in test suite
- ✅ Verified working (200 OK, 8 resources returned)
- ✅ No code changes needed in backend
