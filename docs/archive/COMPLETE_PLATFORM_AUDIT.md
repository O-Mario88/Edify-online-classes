# 1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

## What This Platform Is

Edify Online School (branded "Maple Online School" in some frontend strings) is a **full-stack EdTech operating system** designed for the East African education market (Uganda, Kenya, Rwanda). It serves multiple user roles across institutional and independent learning contexts, with deep curriculum alignment to UNEB (Uganda National Examinations Board) standards.

The platform attempts to be an all-in-one solution covering: learning management, live sessions, assessments, marketplace, finance/ERP, analytics, AI tutoring, gamification, parent engagement, institutional management, and teacher monetization.

## Platform Scale

| Dimension | Count |
|-----------|-------|
| Backend Django Apps | 21 |
| Database Models | 100+ |
| API Endpoints | 75+ |
| Frontend Pages | 45 |
| Frontend Components | ~80 feature components + 48 UI primitives |
| Routes | ~35 unique routes |
| User Roles | 16 (5 platform-level + 11 institutional) |
| Permissions | 17 defined |

## Strongest Areas

1. **Curriculum & Academic Structure** — Deep UNEB-aligned curriculum hierarchy (Country → Track → Level → Class → Subject → Topic → Subtopic → Lesson) with real API and full-tree endpoint
2. **Authentication & Onboarding** — Complete JWT auth with dual-backend (email + system_username), student onboarding with parent auto-creation, institutional learner registration with payment verification
3. **Intelligence Engine** — Sophisticated NBA engine, study planner, health scorer, story card generator with 22 models — the most advanced backend app
4. **Marketplace & Teacher Monetization** — Full payout lifecycle with wallet, eligibility checks, lesson qualification engine, mobile money integration (MTN MoMo), 80/20 revenue split
5. **AI Integration** — Live OpenAI GPT-4o-mini integration for copilot with context routing, graceful mock fallback
6. **Resource Management** — Vimeo video pipeline with async Celery processing, visibility-scoped queries, engagement tracking
7. **Grading System** — NCDC 20/80 formative/summative engine with grade mapping, PDF report card generation via WeasyPrint
8. **RBAC System** — Full 17-permission × 16-role matrix enforced at both route and component levels

## Weakest Areas

1. **Dashboard Action Links** — 30+ broken route references across all 4 dashboards pointing to non-existent routes
2. **Teacher Experience** — 17 teacher components, ALL hardcoded/simulated — zero real API connections
3. **Parent Experience** — Comprehensive dashboard layout but every action button is dead
4. **Placeholder Pages** — 17 pages are 100% mock data with no API integration
5. **Orphaned Pages** — 5 complete pages (including a 90%-done Finance Hub) exist but are not routed
6. **Dual API Client** — Two incompatible API clients (`apiClient.ts` fetch-based, `api.ts` axios-based) used inconsistently
7. **Missing Route Protection** — 4 admin/institutional routes have no `ProtectedRoute` wrapper

## Overall Completion Level

| Category | Estimate |
|----------|----------|
| Backend (models, APIs, business logic) | **75-80%** |
| Frontend UI (component & page shells) | **80-85%** |
| End-to-End Wiring (frontend ↔ backend) | **35-40%** |
| Feature Completeness (usable by real users) | **30-35%** |

The platform has excellent architectural ambition and a strong backend, but the frontend-to-backend wiring gap is the primary blocker preventing real usability.

# 3. DETAILED FEATURE DOCUMENTATION

## A. AUTHENTICATION & ONBOARDING

### A1. Email/Password Login

**Module**: Authentication  
**Roles**: All users  
**Location**: `/login` — LoginPage  
**Purpose**: Authenticate users and establish JWT session  
**Description**: Full-screen login form with email and password fields. Delegates to `useAuth().login()` which posts to `/api/v1/auth/login/`. On success, stores access + refresh tokens in localStorage, fetches user profile, and redirects to appropriate dashboard based on role. Includes demo account quick-login buttons (4 preset accounts with `demo123` password) for development testing. Role is inferred from email patterns (`@admin` → platform_admin, `@institution` → institution_admin).  
**Core Actions**: Submit login form, click demo account button  
**States**: Idle, loading (spinner on button), error (inline error message)  
**Data Dependencies**: `/api/v1/auth/token/` endpoint  
**Outputs**: JWT tokens stored in localStorage, user state set in AuthContext, redirect to role dashboard  
**Connected Features**: AuthContext, DashboardRouter, All protected routes  
**Implementation Status**: ✅ Fully implemented  
**Gaps**: No "Forgot Password" flow — label exists but has no handler. No rate limiting on frontend. No account lockout display.  
**Recommendation**: Implement password reset flow. Add rate-limit feedback. Add 2FA option.

---

### A2. Student Registration (Independent)

**Module**: Authentication & Onboarding  
**Roles**: New users (unauthenticated)  
**Location**: `/register` — RegisterPage  
**Purpose**: Create new independent student accounts with automatic parent record creation  
**Description**: Multi-mode registration page with 3 paths: Learner, Teacher, Institution. The Learner path is a 3-step wizard: (1) Account details (full_name, email, country_code, password), (2) Parent details (creates parent record linked to student), (3) Payment method selection (MTN MoMo / Airtel Money — cosmetic only, no real payment). Uses `useAuth().onboardStudent()` which posts to `/api/v1/auth/onboard-student/`. Backend atomically creates parent (lookup-or-create by phone), student profile, and parent-student link in one transaction.  
**Core Actions**: Fill wizard steps, submit registration  
**States**: Step 1 (account), Step 2 (parent), Step 3 (payment), loading, error  
**Data Dependencies**: `/api/v1/auth/onboard-student/` endpoint  
**Outputs**: User account + StudentProfile + ParentProfile + ParentStudentLink created. JWT tokens returned.  
**Connected Features**: AuthContext, Parent Dashboard  
**Implementation Status**: ✅ Mostly functional  
**Gaps**: Payment step is cosmetic (no real payment integration). Post-registration redirects to non-existent `/student-dashboard` (should be `/dashboard/student`). Teacher invite code verification not connected.  
**Recommendation**: Fix redirect path. Wire payment to real gateway. Connect teacher invite code verification to backend.

---

### A3. Institutional Learner Registration (3-Step)

**Module**: Institution Management  
**Roles**: Institution admin (performing onboarding)  
**Location**: Institution Management Page → Students tab → StudentOnboardingForm  
**Purpose**: Register new students within an institution with payment verification and automatic credential generation  
**Description**: 3-step onboarding wizard: (1) **Profile** — student name, class level, Learner Identification Number (LIN). (2) **Parent & Pay** — parent name/phone collection, registration submitted to `/institutions/learner-registrations/start_registration/`, then auto-verifies payment via `/verify_payment/`. Detects siblings by parent phone number. (3) **Account** — 4-digit PIN creation, calls `/finalize_account/` which generates student ID + system username (e.g., "maple-ug-1234"). Displayed credentials can be copied.  
**Core Actions**: Fill each step, submit registration, copy credentials  
**States**: Step 1, Step 2, Step 3, loading per step, error display  
**Data Dependencies**: Institution context, `/api/v1/institutions/learner-registrations/` endpoints  
**Outputs**: LearnerRegistration record (6-step status flow), User account, StudentProfile, ParentProfile  
**Connected Features**: InstitutionManagementPage, ParentStudentLink, Student Dashboard  
**Implementation Status**: ✅ Fully functional — real API, real credential generation  
**Gaps**: Payment verification is auto-approved (simulated). LIN validation not enforced.  
**Recommendation**: Wire real payment verification. Add LIN format validation.

---

### A8. Institution Onboarding Wizard

**Module**: Onboarding  
**Roles**: New institution administrators (unauthenticated)  
**Location**: `/institution-onboarding` — InstitutionWizard  
**Purpose**: Guide new institutions through complete platform setup  
**Description**: 10-step wizard designed to onboard an entire school: (1) Institution Account, (2) Branding, (3) Academic Structure, (4) Roles & Permissions, (5) Teachers, (6) Students, (7) Parents, (8) Billing & Activation, (9) School Setup, (10) Go Live. Only steps 1-3 have actual form UI. Steps 4-10 show "Phase Pending" placeholder.  
**Core Actions**: Fill form fields, navigate between steps  
**States**: Active step, completed steps visually marked  
**Data Dependencies**: None — simulated setTimeout submission  
**Outputs**: None (no API call made)  
**Connected Features**: Intended to create Institution + memberships + billing  
**Implementation Status**: ⚠️ 30% — 3 of 10 steps have UI, no real API submission  
**Gaps**: Steps 4-10 are empty placeholders. Form submission uses setTimeout, never calls backend. Backend has `/api/v1/institutions/onboard-basic/` endpoint ready.  
**Recommendation**: Wire steps 1-3 to `/institutions/onboard-basic/`. Build UI for steps 4-10 progressively.

---

### A9. Independent Teacher Onboarding Wizard

**Module**: Onboarding  
**Roles**: New independent teachers (unauthenticated)  
**Location**: `/independent-teacher-onboarding` — IndependentTeacherWizard  
**Purpose**: Register and set up independent teachers with monetization profile  
**Description**: Designed as 8-step wizard but only 4 steps implemented: (1) Account Setup (name, phone, email, password, country), (2) Credibility (bio, experience, specialization), (3) Monetization Disclosure (terms acceptance gate), (4) Payout Setup (MTN/Airtel network, account name, phone). Future steps: Content Offers, First Lesson, Public Profile, Launch Dashboard. Progress indicator shows `/8` denominator.  
**Core Actions**: Fill each step, accept monetization terms, configure payout  
**States**: Step 1-4, completion state  
**Data Dependencies**: None — simulated setTimeout, comments reference `/api/marketplace/onboard-teacher/`  
**Outputs**: None (no API call made)  
**Connected Features**: Backend has `/api/v1/marketplace/onboard-teacher/` ready  
**Implementation Status**: ⚠️ 40% — 4 of 8 steps have UI, no API  
**Gaps**: Steps 5-8 not built. Submission simulated. Progress bar bug (shows /8 but only 4 exist).  
**Recommendation**: Wire to `/marketplace/onboard-teacher/` endpoint. Build remaining 4 steps. Fix progress indicator.

---

## B. CLASS & ACADEMIC NAVIGATION

### B1. Course Catalog

**Module**: Academic Navigation  
**Roles**: All users (public)  
**Location**: `/classes` — CourseCatalog  
**Purpose**: Browse and discover available classes/grade levels  
**Description**: Grid of class cards fetched from `/curriculum/full-tree/`. Filter tabs: ALL, O'LEVEL, A'LEVEL, SCIENCES, ARTS. Each card shows class name, student count (random — mock), rating (hardcoded 4.9), and teacher name (from supplementary `/data/users.json` fetch). Click navigates to class syllabus.  
**Core Actions**: Filter by category, click class card  
**States**: Loading spinner, normal grid  
**Data Dependencies**: `/api/v1/curriculum/full-tree/`, `/data/users.json` (static)  
**Outputs**: Navigation to `/classes/:classId`  
**Connected Features**: ClassSyllabusPage, CourseDetail  
**Implementation Status**: ✅ 85% — Real API, cosmetic mock augmentation (counts, ratings)  
**Gaps**: Student counts are random. Ratings hardcoded. No enrollment status indicator.  
**Recommendation**: Wire student counts from enrollment API. Calculate real ratings.

---

### B2. Class Syllabus View

**Module**: Academic Navigation  
**Roles**: All users (public)  
**Location**: `/classes/:classId` — ClassSyllabusPage

**Purpose**: Browse and purchase educational content organized by curriculum structure  
**Description**: 3-level marketplace hierarchy:

**Level 1 — Subject Grid** (`/marketplace`): Fetches subjects from `/api/v1/curriculum/subjects/`. Card grid with search and country filter. Connection status indicator (green dot for API connection, warning for fallback). Each card links to subject page.

**Level 2 — Subject Page** (`/marketplace/:country/:subjectId`): Breadcrumbs, subject header, tabs by class level. Displays topic cards with resource counts (video/notes/test — currently random mock). Right sidebar with "Top Tutors in Subject" (hardcoded) and "Live Support Available" (hardcoded). Each topic links to topic page.

**Level 3 — Topic Page** (`/marketplace/:country/:subjectId/:classId/:topicId`): Breadcrumbs, topic header, tabbed by content type (Videos/Notes/Tests). Fetches real marketplace listings from `/api/v1/marketplace/listing/?topic_bindings__topic={id}`. Displays listing cards with price, rating, student count. "Unlock Lesson" button enabled only for `universal_student` role.

**Core Actions**: Search, filter by country, browse subjects → topics → listings, unlock/purchase content  
**States**: Loading, empty, normal, connected/disconnected  
**Data Dependencies**: Curriculum API, Marketplace Listings API  
**Outputs**: Navigation through marketplace hierarchy, content purchase (backend)  
**Connected Features**: MarketplaceUploadModal (teacher content upload), Teacher Wallet (revenue), Revenue split  
**Implementation Status**: ✅ 85% — Real API throughout, functional navigation  
**Gaps**: Resource counts at subject level are random. Tutor sidebar is hardcoded. "Unlock Lesson" doesn't show purchase confirmation/payment flow. No review system surfaced.  
**Recommendation**: Wire resource counts from listing aggregation. Build tutor profile integration. Add purchase confirmation flow. Surface reviews.

## L. COMMUNICATION & NOTIFICATIONS

### L1. WhatsApp Integration

**Module**: Notifications  
**Roles**: Teachers, Institution admins  
**Location**: Backend notifications app, IntegrationsService in frontend  
**Purpose**: Send WhatsApp messages to parents and students via Twilio  
**Description**: Backend `NotificationViewSet` has `send-whatsapp` custom action that integrates with Twilio WhatsApp API. Frontend `IntegrationsService.sendWhatsAppTemplate()` posts to `/api/v1/notifications/notification/send-whatsapp/`. Includes a simulator fallback when Twilio credentials aren't present. `WhatsAppCommunicationHub` component provides a WhatsApp-clone chat UI but uses hardcoded messages only.  
**Core Actions**: Send WhatsApp template message, test connection  
**States**: Sent, failed, simulated  
**Data Dependencies**: Twilio API credentials, recipient phone numbers  
**Outputs**: Notification record, WhatsApp message delivered  
**Connected Features**: NotificationPreferences panel, TeacherDashboard (NBA "Message Parents" action)  
**Implementation Status**: ✅ Backend real (Twilio + fallback), Frontend partially wired  
**Gaps**: WhatsApp chat UI is hardcoded (not connected to real messages). No conversation history. Phone numbers hardcoded in preferences.  
**Recommendation**: Connect chat UI to real message thread. Wire recipient from student/parent records. Build conversation history.

## N. EXAM REGISTRATION

### N1-N5. National Exam Registration

**Module**: Exams  
**Roles**: universal_student  
**Location**: `/exam-registration` — ExamRegistrationPage  
**Purpose**: Register students for UNEB national examinations (UCE/UACE/PLE) with compliant subject selection  
**Description**: Multi-step wizard: (1) Search and select exam center from `/api/v1/exams/exam-center/`. (2) Choose exam type (UCE O-Level or UACE A-Level) and academic year. (3) Subject selection with full UNEB validation rules: O-Level requires 8-9 subjects (7 core compulsories + electives), A-Level requires GP + 3 principals + 1 subsidiary = 5 subjects. Validation uses `SubjectValidation` from `@/lib/subjectConfig` with detailed error messages. (4) Document upload (ID copy, academic records, passport photo — sends filenames not actual files). (5) Fee calculation based on subject count. (6) Submit registration to `/api/v1/exams/candidate-registration/`.  
**Core Actions**: Search centers, select exam type, choose subjects, upload documents, calculate fees, submit  
**States**: Step progression, validation errors, loading, submitted  
**Data Dependencies**: Exam centers API, UNEB subject catalog, registration rules  
**Outputs**: CandidateRegistration + SubjectSelection records  
**Connected Features**: UNEB curriculum config, Assessment system  
**Implementation Status**: ✅ 80% — Real API, comprehensive validation  
**Gaps**: Document upload sends filenames not files (no actual upload). Board submission batch not triggered. Fee payment not integrated. Alert() used for some confirmations instead of proper UI.  
**Recommendation**: Implement real document upload. Wire fee calculation to payment system. Replace alert() with proper dialogs. Build board batch submission for admin.

**Location**: AICopilotWidget (Layout shell), AITeacherCopilotWidget (Lesson Studio), AITeachingAssistant (dedicated page)  
**Purpose**: AI-powered learning and teaching assistant using GPT-4o-mini  
**Description**: Live OpenAI GPT-4o-mini integration with 4 context routing modes: `quiz_generator` (generates JSON quiz structure), `smart_reply` (drafts parent/admin communications), `teaching_analytics` (analyzes class performance data), `general` (open-ended tutor). Student widget is floating action button in Layout shell with quick chips ("Physics Quiz", "Summarize Lesson"). Teacher widget is card-based in Lesson Studio. Full-page AITeachingAssistant has 3 tabs: Live Analytics (with mock chart + real AI analysis), Smart Replies (real AI generation), Quiz Generator (real AI JSON quiz). Chat state managed by AICopilotContext. Falls back to mock responses if OpenAI API key is missing. Each request creates an AIJob record for audit.  
**Core Actions**: Send messages, generate quiz, draft reply, analyze data  
**States**: Idle, loading (thinking animation), response received, error, offline  
**Data Dependencies**: OpenAI API key, user message, context type  
**Outputs**: AI-generated text/JSON, AIJob + AIOutput records for audit  
**Connected Features**: TeacherLessonStudio, Layout (student widget)  
**Implementation Status**: ✅ 85% — Real AI integration with graceful fallback  
**Gaps**: Chart data in analytics tab is mock. Quiz JSON output not automatically converted to Assessment records. Smart replies not sent through notification system. No conversation persistence across sessions.  
**Recommendation**: Wire quiz output to Assessment creation API. Connect smart replies to notification/WhatsApp system. Add conversation history persistence.

# 7. WEAK / MISSING FEATURE REPORT

## Critical Missing Features

### 1. Dashboard Action Routing
**What exists**: 30+ actionLink URLs in intelligence cards across all dashboards  
**What's missing**: The target routes don't exist in App.tsx (e.g., `/dashboard/library`, `/dashboard/analytics`, `/dashboard/interventions`, `/dashboard/earnings`)  
**Impact**: Every dashboard feels non-functional — users click links that go nowhere  
**Fix**: Either create the missing pages or update links to point to existing pages

### 2. Finance Hub Routing
**What exists**: 90% complete finance management hub with real API integration  
**What's missing**: No route in App.tsx  
**Impact**: The most complete unshipped feature is invisible to users  
**Fix**: Add route `/dashboard/institution/finance` with ProtectedRoute

### 3. Analytics Layout Routing
**What exists**: 3 analytics pages with real API + Recharts, plus sidebar layout with permission guards  
**What's missing**: No `/analytics/*` routes in App.tsx  
**Impact**: Complete analytics suite is invisible  
**Fix**: Add 6 analytics routes under Layout wrapper

### 4. Route Protection Gaps
**What exists**: 4 dashboard routes with NO ProtectedRoute wrapper  
**What's missing**: Auth guards on admin intelligence hub, risk monitor, institution health, offline upload  
**Impact**: Any authenticated user can access admin/institution data  
**Fix**: Wrap all 4 routes in ProtectedRoute with appropriate role restrictions

## High Priority Gaps

### 5. Teacher Component API Wiring
**What exists**: 17 polished teacher components (payout status, quality score, intervention bundle, etc.)  
**What's missing**: ALL 17 components use hardcoded/simulated data — zero API connections  
**Impact**: Teacher dashboard looks impressive but is a complete shell  
**Fix**: Wire each component to corresponding intelligence/analytics/marketplace API endpoints

### 6. Timetable Frontend-Backend Gap
**What exists**: Backend has full timetable CRUD + collision detection + auto-allocator. Frontend has mock grid.  
**What's missing**: Frontend API integration, interactive CRUD, auto-allocator button  
**Impact**: Most valuable operations feature is unusable  
**Fix**: Wire timetable studio to `/api/v1/scheduling/timetable/` endpoints, build drag-and-drop interface

### 7. Attendance Frontend-Backend Gap
**What exists**: Backend has daily + lesson attendance CRUD with RBAC. Frontend has interactive matrix.  
**What's missing**: Frontend uses `alert()` for save, no API calls  
**Impact**: Teachers can mark attendance but it's lost on refresh  
**Fix**: Wire submit to `/api/v1/attendance/daily/` endpoint

### 8. Dashboard Action Buttons
**What exists**: ~50 buttons across all dashboards (View Schedule, Resume Learning, Join Meeting, etc.)  
**What's missing**: onClick handlers on nearly all buttons  
**Impact**: Dashboards look functional but nothing is clickable  
**Fix**: Prioritize high-traffic buttons (Resume Learning, View Schedule, Join Meeting)

## Medium Priority Gaps

### 9. Dual API Client Inconsistency
**What exists**: `apiClient.ts` (fetch-based with JWT refresh) and `api.ts` (axios-based with interceptors)  
**What's missing**: Unified approach — some pages use one, some the other  
**Impact**: Potential auth header inconsistencies, maintenance burden  
**Fix**: Standardize on `apiClient.ts` (more complete), migrate all `api.ts` usage

### 10. Resource Engagement Persistence
**What exists**: Client-side tracking (time, scroll, progress) via hooks + localStorage  
**What's missing**: API persistence to `/intelligence/learning-progress/` endpoint  
**Impact**: All reading/watching progress lost when clearing browser data  
**Fix**: Periodically POST engagement snapshots to backend LearningProgress model

### 11. Intervention System
**What exists**: Models, risk engine (simulated), intervention plans, effectiveness tracker  
**What's missing**: API endpoints (`views.py` is empty), frontend integration  
**Impact**: Entire intervention workflow is invisible  
**Fix**: Build ViewSet for intervention models, surface in teacher dashboard

### 12. Report Card Access
**What exists**: Full NCDC grading engine, PDF generation via Celery + WeasyPrint  
**What's missing**: No frontend page to view or download report cards  
**Impact**: Even when grades are calculated and reports generated, nobody can see them  
**Fix**: Add report card viewer to student and parent dashboards, admin bulk generation UI

### 13. Parent Finance Experience
**What exists**: Household Finance tab in parent dashboard  
**What's missing**: All data is hardcoded — no connection to institution finance APIs  
**Impact**: Parents can't see real billing/payment information  
**Fix**: Wire to institution finance endpoints scoped by parent-student links

### 14. Onboarding Wizard Completion
**What exists**: Institution wizard (3/10 steps), Teacher wizard (4/8 steps)  
**What's missing**: Remaining steps + API submission  
**Impact**: Neither wizard creates actual backend records  
**Fix**: Wire existing steps to backend APIs, build remaining step UIs progressively
